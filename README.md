> [!NOTE]  
> This repo was created in 2024, the tasks provided here are not based on the JavaScript syntax and behavior only, but any other languages can possibly handle them. Since JavaScript is my native programming language and most preferable one and since it as well as my knowledge has been constantly evolving, there are newer language features, newer and better solutions to problems here.

<p>
 [InfiniteJS](https://gpx.ge/infiniteJS/) has been developing in parallel with my web developer career. It was conceived as a more understandable alternative to our dear [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), well... for beginners at least. Practically, it resembled a detective's notebook: practical for inner usage and bit abstract for outer glance. It went beyond JavaScript and covered almost every aspect I encountered in my career growth.

This repo requested a name and idea from Infinite JavaScript. The origin of the tasks is very diverse: I had to thank CS50 for some of them, I encountered some in practice, and some...

I tried to offer interesting and wonderful tasks. 👴🏻 We are starting to enjoy our own little successes! 🧲 🧁 ⚱️</p>
